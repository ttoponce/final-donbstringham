# Final - Points **400**

You are going to build the back-end for a Q&A App with PHP7, Illuminate Database and the Eloquent ORM.  The user interface is to be functional, **not** beautiful.  You will be required to write many of your own unit-tests, so in a sense you are grading yourself.  This will be the most subjective assignment the whole semester.
